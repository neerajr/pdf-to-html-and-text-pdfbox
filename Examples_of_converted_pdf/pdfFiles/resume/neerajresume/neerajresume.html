<p> SEMINAR 
 3-D Packaging Technology: 3-D die stacking is an exciting new technology that increases transistor  
density by vertically integrating two or more die with a dense, high-speed interface. The result of 3D  
die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system.
