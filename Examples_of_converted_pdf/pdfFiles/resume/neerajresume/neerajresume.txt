Temporal based encoding schema for crosstalk minimization in Interconnects.
 Abstract :-The project proposes extensive study of interconnect modeling and analysis of existing 
methods for  Crosstalk  minimization in  interconnects.  The project  also proposes a temporal  based 
novel method   
 for crosstalk minimization and development of Integrated Analysis Environment (IAE) for  
 implementing the crosstalk minimization methods.
 SEMINAR 
 3-D Packaging Technology: 3-D die stacking is an exciting new technology that increases transistor  
density by vertically integrating two or more die with a dense, high-speed interface. The result of 3D  
die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system.
