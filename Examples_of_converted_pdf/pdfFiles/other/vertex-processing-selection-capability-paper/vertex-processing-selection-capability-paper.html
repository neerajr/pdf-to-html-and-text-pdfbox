<p>2.1 Introduction 
</p>
<p>Intel recently introduced the 15.6 and 14.31 Windows Vista* and Windows* XP 
graphics drivers that enables Shader Model 3.0 including support for hardware vertex 
shader and HW TnL on the Intel&#174; G965, GM965, and G35 Express Chipsets.  This 
capability has shown enhancements in game compatibility as well as game play. Along 
with this capability, Intel also introduced a vertex processing selection capability which 
allows the drivers to switch between using the integrated graphics engine and the 
Intel processors for vertex processing depending on the application. The end result is 
that Intel is able to deliver the highest possible frame rates by leveraging Intel&#8217;s world 
class processors.  
</p>
<p>2.2 Integrated Graphics Architecture 
</p>
<p>The Intel GMA X3x00 architecture is based upon a unified shader architecture that is 
comprised of a collection of highly programmable and scalable 32-bit floating point 
engines.  This programmable architecture is one based upon a unified shader model, 
which means both vertex shaders and pixels shaders run on the same programmable 
engines.  These same programmable engines are also able to process media codecs, 
as well as various filters for text and image processing.  The Intel graphics driver 
architecture delivers scalability and flexibility by supporting features within kernels 
that are compiled for the Intel graphics architecture.  At the high level there are 
kernels that support 3D and media.  Within 3D there are kernels for DirectX* and 
OpenGL*.  DirectX* then has kernels that support pixel and vertex shading, and 
filtering.  OpenGL has fragment and vertex shading, as well as filtering kernels.  The 
media kernels are codec dependent, but capabilities like IDCT (Inverse Discrete 
Cosine Transform), motion compensation, and filtering techniques like advanced de-
interlacing would all be supported by a kernel.  Figure 1 is a view of the driver 
architecture with kernels.

<p>White Paper   7 
</p>
<p>2.3 Why Vertex Processing Selection Capability? 
</p>
<p>In the process of designing and enabling a driver that supports Vertex Processing and 
TnL, Intel engineers discovered that some applications, mainly 3D games, performed 
better with vertex processing done on the processor rather than on the graphics 
engine.  As mentioned above, the architecture uses the same programmable engines 
to process all shaders.  By off-loading some of the vertex shader processing to the 
processor, the graphics engine is able to process more pixel shader data and do 
additional work like anisotropic filtering.  Therefore, the graphics engine is able to do 
more while staying within market required power, thermal, and cost envelopes. 
</p>
<p>Separate vertex shader and pixel shader units within the graphics engine was a 
potential design option for Intel graphics engines.  However, upon analysis of various 
3D applications, it was discovered that the vertex traffic is at the beginning of each 
scene, and only accounted for one-third of the compute requirements for a scene.  On 
the other hand, pixel traffic is about two-thirds of the scene and required most of the 
compute resources.  So for much of the time the vertex shaders would be sitting idle.  
Of course this is application specific and one we will explore further.  Figure 2 shows a 
small sample of applications that perform better with Vertex Processing being done on 
our integrated graphics parts.  As one can see Age of Empires 3* receives a modest 
gain of 15%, while Far Cry* and Hal-Life 2 Episode 1* see extremely large gains of 
95% and 230% respectively.   Figure 3 shows a small sample of applications and the 
benefits of software vertex processing.  When using software vertex processing, the 
performance benefit gained over hardware vertex processing ranges from 30-65% 
across a small sample of games. A 30% performance benefit was measured for 
FEAR*, 60% for Guild Wars* and 65% for Grand Theft Auto*. See Figure 3 below.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2.4 Driver Architecture for Vertex Processing 
Selection Capability 
</p>
<p>Within any given 3D API there are certain capabilities that are exposed to the 
application.  The Intel graphics driver always exposes Vertex Shader 3.0, and below, 
as well as HW TnL capabilities bits by default.  Many applications perform best when 
the vertex processing is done on Intel graphics engines.  As stated above, there are 
several exceptions where the application may perform better when vertex processing 
is done on a processor.  If the application performs better with processor-based vertex 
processing, and has met Intel&#8217;s selection criteria, it is placed in a list of applications 
contained within the driver INF file.  The driver detects the application executables, 
turns off the integrated graphics vertex processing path and turns on the PSGP path 
that runs on an Intel processor.  Figure 4 is a block diagram showing the graphics 
engine path (HWVP).  Figure 5 is a block diagram showing the processor path (SWVP).    
</p>
<p>Applications are validated across different configurations and results are reviewed to 
determine which applications qualify for inclusion into the PSGP list.  As new 
applications are launched, they are reviewed for inclusion on the list as shown below 
in Figure 6 (a list of 3D applications that are supported by the PSGP (SWVP)). </p>

<p>2.5 Summary 
</p>
<p>Intel recently introduced graphic driver versions 15.6 and 14.31 for Windows Vista 
and Windows XP that enable Shader Model 3.0 (including support for hardware vertex 
shader and HW TnL on the Intel&#174; G965, GM965, and G35 Express Chipsets.)  Intel 
also introduced the capability to switch between HWVP and SWVP based upon the 3D 
application running on Intel integrated graphics engines.  Results showed that some 
3D applications perform best with HWVP, which is the default configuration.  In other 
instances, results showed that some 3D applications perform best with SWVP.  Intel&#8217;s 
goal is to provide the best user experience possible for 3D applications while 
leveraging the performance of the processor where it makes sense.
